# Departures from specific stations.
A simple API fetch for departures from specific stations.
It's simply just coded to show Råcksta and Årstadal and is quiet simple to change which station you want to view by 
searching the station name at this api fetch: https://transport.integration.sl.se/v1/sites?expand=true
Then you change the api url siteid to whatever station you wish to show.
And depending on what it is you can change the text to be shown on the page.
